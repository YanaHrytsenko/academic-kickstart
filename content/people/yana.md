I am a second year PhD student in Computer Science. Currently, I am working on developing efficient

and accurate methods for distance calculations between genomes. 

I received my Masters degree in Computer Science from Brown University, Rhode Island in 2017.

During my Masters I worked on [theoretical model] of using Blockchain data structure for Public Key Infrastructure.

While at Brown, I took a course in Computational Molecular Biology, where I developed a strong interest for working with genomic data.

This led me to my current research interests. I am working with Dr.Schwartz, Evolutionary Biologist and Dr.Daniels, Computer Scientist,

who are both my PhD co-advisors and mentors.

In addition to programming, my interests include traveling, Pilates, watching NASCAR and Formula 1 racing events,"Girl with a Dragon Tattoo", and Lana Del Rey.
